# Error Detection

A web-based educational tool to help users understand and visualize various error detection and correction algorithms used in digital communication systems.
This project provides interactive demonstrations of key error detection and correction techniques such as Vertical Redundancy Check (VRC), Longitudinal Redundancy Check (LRC), Checksum, Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), and Hamming Code. It is designed as an educational resource for students and anyone interested in computer networks or digital systems.
